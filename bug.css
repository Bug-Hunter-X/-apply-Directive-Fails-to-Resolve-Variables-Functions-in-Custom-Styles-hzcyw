This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with custom styles that contain variables or functions.  The `@apply` directive might not correctly resolve the values of these variables or functions, leading to unexpected styles or rendering issues. For example:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
}

.my-custom-style {
  @apply bg-blue-500; /* This works fine */
  @apply bg-var(--primary-color); /* This might not work as expected */
}
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` works correctly, but `bg-var(--primary-color)` might not apply the variable's value if the `@apply` directive doesn't handle variable resolution properly. Similarly, using functions within `@apply` can lead to similar issues.
